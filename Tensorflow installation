To create a virtual environment in Python where TensorFlow can run smoothly, following commands are being used in Anaconda prompt window. 
P.S. A Python virtual environment provides isolated environments for Python projects. This implies that every project can have its own dependencies, in spite of what dependencies every other project has.
Step 1: >conda create -n tensorflow
Proceed ([y]/n)? y
Step 2: >activate tensorflow
Proceed ([y]/n)? y
Step 3: >python
Step 4: >spyder
